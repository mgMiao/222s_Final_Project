* one RGB led to show the color of the temperature
  1. pink less than 20 celsius
  2. green 20 to 25 celsius
  3. blue 25 to 30 celsius

***Extra credit:***
* 4-led-matrix (display the temperature)
* mysql database for log in (restore information login and register in the database), and the feeding time information
* using bootsrap as an external css library for the UI
* setting up Apache and put our UI in the server so it is more likely to be used as an app
